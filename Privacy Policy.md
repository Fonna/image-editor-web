**Last Updated:** [Date, January 8, 2026]

## 1. Introduction
Welcome to **Bananaimage**. We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share your information when you use our AI-powered image generation services.

## 2. Information We Collect
We collect information that you provide to us directly:
* **Account Information:** Email address, username, and password.
* **User Content:** Text prompts, negative prompts, and images you upload for image-to-image generation.
* **Generated Content:** The images generated by our service based on your inputs.
* **Payment Information:** We use third-party payment processors (e.g., Creem). We do not store your credit card details on our servers.

## 3. How We Use Your Information
We use your information to:
* Provide, operate, and maintain our AI generation tools.
* **Process AI Generations:** To generate images, your text prompts and uploaded images are processed by our system and may be transmitted to third-party AI model providers (such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, or other API partners) strictly for the purpose of content generation.
* Improve our services and fix bugs.
* Send you administrative information, such as updates to terms or policy changes.

## 4. Sharing Information with Third Parties
We do not sell your personal data. However, due to the nature of our "AI Router" service, we must share specific data to function:
* **AI Model Providers:** Your prompts and input images are sent to external AI models to generate the final output. These providers are not authorized to use your personal data for other purposes.
* **Service Providers:** We may use hosting services (e.g., AWS, Cloudflare) and payment processors (e.g., Creem) to run our business.

## 5. Data Retention
We retain your generated images and prompts for a limited period to allow you to access your history. You may delete your generated content at any time through your user dashboard.
